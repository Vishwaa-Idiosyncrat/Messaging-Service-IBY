Technologies Used in the Project
1. Next.js

    Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js provides server-side rendering capabilities, which can boost performance and improve SEO by generating HTML on the server for each request.
    Static Site Generation (SSG): It supports static site generation, enhancing performance by pre-rendering pages at build time.
    API Routes: Next.js allows for the creation of API endpoints directly within the application, simplifying both development and deployment processes.
    Built-In Routing: The file-based routing system of Next.js makes it easy to manage and structure the application's pages and routes.
    Automatic Code Splitting: It automatically splits code, loading only the necessary parts for each page, which helps to improve load times.

2. NextAuth.js

    Simplified Authentication: NextAuth.js simplifies adding authentication to Next.js applications, with support for various providers like Google, GitHub, and others.
    Built-In Sessions: It includes built-in support for session management, which streamlines handling user sessions and authentication states.
    Customizable: Offers extensive customization options, including the use of custom databases and various authentication flows.
    Secure: Provides security features such as encrypted sessions and secure token handling to protect user data.

3. Prisma

    Type-Safe Database Access: Prisma generates TypeScript types for the database schema, which helps in catching errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
    Efficient Database Queries: It provides a powerful query engine that allows for building and executing database queries efficiently.
    Database Migrations: Prisma supports database migrations, making it easy to manage and evolve the database schema over time.
    Intuitive API: It offers an easy-to-use API for interacting with the database, speeding up development and reducing boilerplate code.

4. bcrypt

    Secure Password Hashing: bcrypt is a popular library for securely hashing passwords. Its computationally intensive algorithm makes it difficult for attackers to crack hashed passwords.
    Salting: It automatically salts passwords before hashing, adding an extra layer of security.
    Ease of Use: The straightforward API for hashing and comparing passwords simplifies integration into the authentication system.

5. Pusher

    Real-Time Capabilities: Pusher adds real-time features to the application, such as live notifications, chat messages, or live updates, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.
    Easy Integration: It provides easy-to-use libraries and APIs for integrating real-time features with minimal setup.
    Scalability: Pusher manages the infrastructure and scaling for real-time features, allowing you to focus on application logic without worrying about scaling issues.
    Cross-Platform Support: Works with various platforms and languages, making it versatile for different types of applications.
